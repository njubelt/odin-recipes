        <p>
            The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek mythology. I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp sea salt</li>
            <li>4 (6 oz) lobster tails</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>Pour about 1 inch of water in the bottom of a large pot and bring to a boil. Add the salt and place a steamer insert inside the pot so that it is just above the water level. Put the lobster tails on the rack and cover the pot. Cover and steam for 8 minutes. And don't peek! Serve with melted butter.</p>
