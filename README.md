# odin-recipes
Simple HTML webpage to display simple recipes. This was created following 
The Odin Project

This is my first attempt at creating a very simple HTML webpage. To increase
the humor statistic, I have created the webpage based around the popular 
1990's TV show, 'Seinfeld.' I have referenced various foods used throughout 
the show and have attempted to provide recipes to recreate the dishes.

the live version of my project. Thank you for your time.
